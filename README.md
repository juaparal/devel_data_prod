##Developing Data Products project

This small Shiny application has been created for the coursera's course Developing Data Products project. Based on a dataset coming from Dr. Hans Hofmann of the University of Hamburg an Rpart tree has been employed as a prediction algorithm.

Instructions to use are very simple:
- Fill the variables on the left side and see the prediction result about Good or Bad credit risk.
- Below the prediction, you have two rCharts as an example to filter the historic data by Age vs Duration or Amount.
- At the end, the prediction tree is also displayed.
